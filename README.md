👋 Hi there, I'm Jameela!

🌸 A language-lover turned programmer, my career took a meaningful turn during my time as an Instructor Associate at General Assembly—helping others grow in tech sparked something special in me.

💻 I spend my time building fun personal projects, diving into new tech stacks, and keeping up with continuous learning. I'm currently brushing up on Flutter!

🛠️ Tech I work with:
- MERN Stack [MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js]
- React Native, Django, Flutter
- JavaScript, Python, SQL, PostgreSQL

🎮 In my free time: I love gaming, exploring haunted places 👻, and curling up with a good book (bonus points if it’s spooky!).

🌼 Dream job? Owning a flower shop filled with cat-friendly plants and code-friendly peace.

🐾 Cat person forever — but really, I love all animals.

📫 Let’s connect and create something cool!
